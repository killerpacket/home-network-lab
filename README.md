üè† Home Network Lab (Packet Tracer)

This project simulates a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates basic VLAN configuration, router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing, and end-to-end connectivity.


üìå Topology
- 1 Router (Cisco 2901)  
- 1 Switch (Cisco 2960)  
- 2 PCs (Staff + Guest)

üßë‚Äçüíª Skills Demonstrated
- VLAN creation and assignment
- Access vs. Trunk ports
- Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Basic network troubleshooting (ping, show commands)



üöÄ How to Use
1. Open home_network_lab.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. View the topology and device configs.
3. Use Command Prompt on the PCs to test pings between devices.
